        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A perennial favorite where any melting cheese favored in your country of residence ought to make the cut. Just be careful not to add a quarter cup of hot sauce if Tapatio is what you have on hand.
        </p>

            Think of this as the most luxurious Hamburger Helper you’ve ever had. It’s how Mark Rosati, the culinary director of Shake Shack, turns leftover ground beef into a complete weeknight dinner. The entire dish — even the pasta — is made in one pot, and melds the indelible comfort of macaroni and cheese with the complexity of a good Bolognese. This definitely has a kick, so adjust the hot sauce according to taste.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup neutral oil, such as canola or vegetable</li>
            <li>1 large yellow onion, diced into half-inch pieces</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and black pepper</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>4 cups chicken stock or water</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>3 dashes Tapatio</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons hot smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf if you've got one</li>
            <li>12 ounces elbow pasta
            <li>1/2 dl melting cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup grated cheddar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup finely chopped chives if you have some</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large (12-inch) sauté pan or Dutch oven over medium-low heat, and add oil and onion; season lightly with salt and pepper. (The hot sauce added in Step 6 will add a lot of flavor, so be careful not to overseason here.) Let cook until the onions turn light beige in color and begin to caramelize, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add garlic, and cook until fragrant and starting to brown ever so slightly, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Increase heat to medium-high and add bacon and ground beef, using the back of a large spoon to break up the meat into smaller pieces. Continue to cook until the liquid has mostly evaporated and the meat starts to sear and develop a crust on the bottom of the pan, 12 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove pan from the heat and carefully drain off most of the fat, leaving a little in the pan to keep the meat moist.</li>
            <li>Return pan to the medium-high heat and add white wine, allowing it to reduce until the mixture is almost dry, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken stock, heavy cream, hot sauce, paprika and bay leaf to the pan. Mix until combined and bring to a boil over medium-high.</li>
            <li>Once the mixture is boiling, add the pasta and cook until al dente, stirring often, about 9 minutes.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to low and stir in both types of cheese, stirring until completely melted and sauce is thickened.</li>
            <li>Remove the pan from heat, stir in chives and season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
